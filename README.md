# Digital-building-schematics-extraction-for-radio-signals-propagation-modeling
The goal of the project consists in importing buildings schematics (first in Autocad format, potentially in other formats) from a C++ program in order to store these schematics in an in-memory structure fitted and optimized for radio signals propagation simulation. This work must be based on the GDAL library and its autocad driver. It will require to go through the resulting OGR structure, to filter the data in order to keep only relevant information and to organize said information in memory, with spatial indexing. According to the students capabilities and advances, an interface to the core simulation tool might be possible.
